## About Multi-Prover AVS
Multi-Prover AVS allows decentralized systems (rollups, coprocessors, L2s) to interact with TEE Provers as a secondary proving mechanism to harden security, with robustness reinforced by TEE Committees. Refer to [Multi-Prover repository](https://github.com/automata-network/multi-prover-avs) to know more details.
